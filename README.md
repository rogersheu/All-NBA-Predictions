# AllLeague-NBA-Predictions

Objective
===========
Using machine learning and deep learning models, identify players most likely to be selected onto either the NBA all-star team (halfway through the season) or an all-NBA team (at the end of the season). Inspiration and/or methodology from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/). Only the overarching information in that post was used. The code was written from scratch or sourced from unrelated analyses found online.

Models
===========
Currently implemented
* Support Vector Machine
* Random Forest

To be implemented or displayed
* Data checks to ensure proper data handling
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Deep Neural Network
* Tableau dashboard of information

Planned Improvements or Refinements
* Ability to use model and update as season progresses
* Other machine learning methods?
* Checking inclusion/exclusion of predictors
* Smaller scale analysis using 538's RAPTOR, EPM, PIPM, or similar.
